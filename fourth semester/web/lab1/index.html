                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Arctic Monkeys arrived in 2005 with a blast. Assisted by online word of mouth -- one of the first bands to benefit from the tangled web of social media -- and rave reviews, Arctic Monkeys quickly became a sensation in the United Kingdom, where the band was seen as the heir apparent to the throne left vacant by Oasis, or perhaps the Libertines, with their 2006 debut Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not briefly grabbing the title of the fastest-selling album in British history. What set the group apart was Alex Turner, a singer/songwriter with a biting wit and grasp of English vernacular (not dissimilar to Paul Weller, the godfather of modern British rock) that doesn't translate to mass American audiences. Arctic Monkeys broke this tradition, cracking the American market without sacrificing Turner's trademark storytelling but by beefing up their guitars, sometimes in association with Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age. Eventually, Arctic Monkeys laced in some of the louche lounge aspects of Turner's swinging side project the Last Shadow Puppets but by that point, the band were a staple throughout the world: a respected, adventurous, and successful group who could easily be called as Britain's biggest band of the first part of the 21st century.</p>

                    Alex Turner and guitarist Jamie Cook began their music careers in 2001, when the friends both received guitars for Christmas. Two years later, they began performing shows around their native Sheffield with drummer Matt Helders and bassist Andy Nicholson, two fellow students at Stocksbridge High School. A series of demo recordings followed, and Arctic Monkeys' audience swelled as fans circulated those recordings via the Internet. The musicians soon found themselves at the center of a growing media circus, with such outlets as BBC Radio examining the band's music and mounting hype.

                        Arctic Monkeys achieved chart success with their first single "I Bet You Look Good on the Dancefloor" which reached number one in the UK Singles Chart.[6] Their first album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, released on 23 January 2006, was at the time the fastest-selling debut album in British music history.[7] It received critical acclaim, winning both the 2006 Mercury Prize[8] and the 2007 BRIT Awards for Best British Album. The band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare, was released on 23 April 2007, sold over 225,000 copies in its debut week, and was nominated for the 2007 Mercury Prize.[9] The group also picked up the award for Best British Album and Best British Group at the BRIT Awards in 2008. Overall, the band has won five BRIT Awards, including "Best British Breakthrough Act" in 2006, "Best British Album" in 2007 for Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and "Best British Group" in 2008. At the NME Awards in 2006, they made history by becoming the first band to win both "Best New Band" and "Best British Band" in the same night.[10] The band were also nominated for 5 Grammy awards. Arctic Monkeys have received 38 awards from 92 nominations.
